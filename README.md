# The conference bible

This collection of documents is meant to serve as a guide for anyone wanting to run their own conference. Although these documents are heavily focused towards cyber security conferences, many of the concepts can be applied to non-cyber security conferences and smaller meet-ups. It's not intended as a defacto standard – many conferences benefit from being delightfully weird and different, breaking the mould on traditional setups. This collection of documents was written to hopefully make the process of organising and running a conference easier for everyone, but that doesn't mean you have to follow all of the advice to the letter otherwise the conference will fail. 

It's a bible, not a gospel.

## Why run a conference?

If you are planning to run a conference, you should have a clear goal in mind for *why* you want to run a conference in the first place. It doesn't need to be a revolutionary, world changing, or ground breaking thought – but running a conference because "it ran the year before" or attempting to "keep up with the Jones'" will lead to a disappointing experience for everyone involved.

Conferences can be _incredibly_ fun to organise and run, if they're done right. Sometimes, however, they can be incredibly stressful affairs for everyone if not enough thought, planning, or resilience is built in.

As an organiser you should ask yourself if you want to *attend* a conference or *organise* one. Organisers (and volunteers for that matter) often don't get to see every talk, if any, and can be pulled pillar to post sorting out problems, ensuring schedules are accurate, or doing other tasks.

## Quick tips

- Check that anything that requires batteries or charging (such as clickers, mic packs, laptops) are fully charged the day before.
- Delegate. All the volunteers are there to help, lean on them as it can't be done alone.
- Ensure all rooms have water for the speakers and volunteers.
- Have backup speakers, panels, and backup volunteers prepped and ready to go.
- Make sure to fulfil any sponsorship promises, such as "shout outs" or social media posts.
- Make sure you have every form of AV connector available and, if all else fails, arm your volunteers with USB sticks to be able to transfer slides from laptop to a known good laptop.
- Test av equipment (such as microphones, projectors, cables) before the conference. Test them again the day before.
- When the conference ends, often organisers/volunteers' jobs aren't over. Talks need uploaded (and captioned), feedback needs sent & curated, transparency reports written etc.
