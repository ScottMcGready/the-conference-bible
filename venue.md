# Venue

One of the harder parts of conference planning is settling on a good venue. Universities/colleges, and hotels with meeting spaces tend to be favourites due to their already structured layout (often benefitting from projectors, screens, and some AV equipment as part of the setup) but it is entirely possible to run a successful conference in nearly any venue you wish so long as some basic thought is put into the venue, your attendees, equipment, and accessibility.

## Accessibility

Older cities in the UK often struggle with accessibility in many venues. Although venues may be listed on their website as accessible, it is often the case that the function room areas are hidden down spiral staircases with narrow entryways. While it would be ideal to only ever select venues that have fully accessibile entrances and facilities, unfortunately it's not always possible. Communicating as much information as possible (such as how many steps, how wide doors are, what the pitch of ramps are) to your attendees, sponsors, speakers, and crew ahead of the conference can allow them to make alternative arrangements to gain access. [Euans guide](https://www.euansguide.com/) is an excellent resource on venues' accessibility, with written reviews.

Some venues may also have fitted induction loops, or audio boosters. Check with the venue beforehand and keep any FAQ section updated as much as possible.

## Equipment

Ensure the venue has the appropriate equipment (such as projectors, tv screens, microphones, power nearby, etc) or plan for what equipment will need to be rented on the day. If 

> **Note:** If microphones are wireless, ensure these are fully charged the day prior, and have fresh sets of batteries ready for any piece of equipment that may run out of juice.

## Logistics

As mentioned in [logistical planning](organisation_and_planning.md#logistics), while attendees won't be angry if a venue simply doesn't have a quiet room, prayer room, accessible entry, or similar - they will be (rightfully) annoyed if it hasn't been considered. Figuring out how to shepherd people around ahead of time helps plan for vendors loading in, people moving between talks, volunteers running around fixing fires, etc.

## Parking

Check with the venue on parking and loading areas. Some attendees may need to park at the venue (such as blue badge holders) but vendors may require temporary parking outside the venue to load any equipment, stands, and items in. If the only parking available is street parking, list this in any communication in advance.

## Room sizes

While a room might look like a large space, it quickly reduces in size when you factor in where to place seats so every attendee can see screens, podiums, projectors, AV equipment etc. Any room you are planning to use for the conference the size should be reduced by ~15%-20% to allow for late arrivals, volunteers moving around, presenters having a good space, and things like attendees needing accessible seating areas.

## Security

While planning for security presence on the day might feel like overkill it can be useful to have a plan for how to (quickly, calmly, and silently) deal with unruly attendees, unwanted guests, protests, and those intent on making the conference a failure if the situation arises. Some venues may provide (or insist on) a physical presence.

## Transport

Assuming some, if not most, of you're attendees don't live in the immediate vicinity of your venue, most will be travelling, and staying (fairly) local, to the venue. The closest train station to the venue might not be the best one and while it may be obvious to yourself if you're a local, but local knowledge is absolute gold dust to attendees that aren't from that area.
