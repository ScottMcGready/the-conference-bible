# Venue

One of the harder parts of conference planning is settling on a good venue. Universities/colleges, and hotels with meeting spaces tend to be favourites due to their already structured layout (often benefitting from projectors, screens, and some AV equipment as part of the setup) but it is entirely possible to run a successful conference in nearly any venue you wish so long as some basic thought is put into the venue, your attendees, equipment, and accessibility.

## Accessibility

Older cities in the UK often struggle with accessibility in many venues. Although venues may be listed on their website as accessible, it is often the case that the function room areas are hidden down spiral staircases with narrow entryways. While it would be ideal to only ever select venues that have fully accessibile entrances and facilities, unfortunately it's not always possible. Communicating as much information as possible (such as how many steps, how wide doors are, what the pitch of ramps are) to your attendees, sponsors, speakers, and crew ahead of the conference can allow them to make alternative arrangements to gain access. [Euans guide](https://www.euansguide.com/) is an excellent resource on venues' accessibility, with written reviews.

Some venues may also have fitted induction loops, or audio boosters. Check with the venue beforehand and keep any FAQ section updated as much as possible.

## Equipment

Ensure the venue has the appropriate equipment (such as projectors, tv screens, microphones, power nearby, etc) or plan for what equipment will need to be rented on the day. If 

> **Note:** If microphones are wireless, ensure these are fully charged the day prior, and have fresh sets of batteries ready for any piece of equipment that may run out of juice.

## Logistics

As mentioned in [logistical planning](organisation_and_planning.md#logistics), 

## Parking

Check with the venue on parking and loading areas. Some attendees may need to park at the venue (such as blue badge holders) but vendors may require temporary parking outside the venue to load any equipment, stands, and items in. If the only parking available is street parking, list this in any communication in advance.

## Room sizes


## Security

While planning for security presence on the day might feel like overkill it can be useful to have a plan for how to (quickly, calmly, and silently) deal with unruly attendees, unwanted guests, protests, and those intent on making the conference a failure if the situation arises. Some venues may provide (or insist on) a physical presence.

## Transport
