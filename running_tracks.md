# Running a track

Each track should have an absolute minimum of 3 volunteers present at any given moment, each with their own specific task. These types are usually [MC](#the-mc-role), [AV](#the-av-role), and [runner](#the-runner-role). All volunteers should have a copy of the schedule for their track to hand, and be aware of any potential issues, special requests, or acommodations that need to be made.

## Introductions

Speakers may have applied to speak with a different name to the one they wish to be introduced as. Checking with a speaker to understand how they want to be introduced, what pronouns to use, and how to pronounce their name properly can ensure the speaker feels welcome and at ease.

Additionally, it's a very nice touch when a conference introduces a speaker and gives the audience a bit of context for the talk, or of the speaker themselves rather than just "this is Tom". Having a document, one per track, with name/handle, pronounciations, talk titles, speaker biography, and talk synopsis can be very handy. Simplifying it completely - even just introducing the speaker, as a representative of the conference, is a very nice touch.

## Speaker management

Giving speakers a quick heads up of what to expect during their talk – such as what a 15/10/5 minute warning will look like from a volunteer, how the MC will introduce them, and that Q&A will be managed by volunteers if they prefer.

Some speakers may prefer not to have a 15/10/5 minute warning, not to be recorded, or not to be asked questions at the end. It's important the track crew are aware of speakers' requests and can try to accomodate them as best as possible.

## Timings

Speakers need a few minutes to get set up before speaking. Ideally, speakers should be in the room (or in a remote green room) at least 15 to 20 minutes before their slot. This allows them to flag down the conference staff and ask any questions they may have, calm nerves, and reiterate any requirements (such as not mentioning the company they work for, pronounciation of names, etc).

Sometimes talks overrun - and that's okay. It's important, within reason, to give speakers the full slot they requested so it's worth finding other areas where you can cut back on time (shaving 5 minutes off at a break, or cutting down opening/closing remarks for example) to keep it to schedule.

Planning a 5 minute buffer between talks can help deal with overruns and allow people to get to the next talk in time.

If, by some miracle, your track is running ahead of schedule it's crucial not to start talks earlier than billed on the programme unless a major shift has been announced – this allows people from other tracks (that might have run on by a minute or so) to have ample time to seat themselves in the talk they wanted to see. Starting talks early can lead to disappointment for attendees who miss a talk and don't want to create a distraction by turning up "late", but also speakers who were expecting more attendees.

## Track roles

Each physical, and virtual, track you run should have a minimum of 3 volunteers, with specific jobs, in the room at any given moment. These can be broken down simply as an MC, an AV volunteer, and a runner. Each has a different, but no less important role in keeping a track running smoothly. Many people mistakenly believe smoothly is equatable to efficiently however, it's the job of your volunteers to ensure the track runs to the best it possibly can within the timings of the official schedule and with the spirit of the conference in mind at all times.

### The MC role

This is the person that is representing your entire conference. It's often the person people will remember most of the volunteers in the room. Care should be taken to select someone who has a good voice of authority, that can command a room, and can do a bit of crowd control, if needed.

You should choose someone to be an MC who's confident at public speaking, charismatic, able to keep the track to time, but also canny enough to allow certain talks to over-run (or indeed under-run) if the situation allows.

MCs should, ideally, introduce speakers (unless a speaker asks not to be introduced), keep the interest of the crowd in situations where technical difficulties are being addressed, keeping Q&A fair, and enforcing the code of conduct.

### The AV role

An often overlooked role, the AV technician's job is to capture the speaker and slides. If your conference benefits from [Cooper's support](organisation_and_planning.md#av--tech) (either in person or the rigs) they'll likely all have a dedicated chat group they can field questions and ensure an operator is in the room for any potential issues, or strange stuff that may be going on. The AV technicians may rely on [runners](#the-runner-role) to fetch other AV technicians, or specific items for AV purposes.

### The runner role

A track "runner" is a volunteer that can be fixing problems behind the scenes allowing the MC and AV volunteers to keep the show running. Runners can get speakers ready for their slot, explaining how things will function (such as AV equipment or timings), letting the MC know the speaker has arrived, and running out to fetch other volunteers if required by the MC or AV volunteer, speaker, or indeed audience members.

A runners only responsibility should be supporting the volunteers and speakers on the track they're in and while it may not seem like a glamourous role, it is no less important than other roles.

## Questions

Some talks will spark a large number of questions, and some may spark silence. It's important to give audience members (and, by extension, the speaker) the opportunity to ask questions, give feedback, or address specific points in the speakers' session.

Keeping Q&A time as fair as possible (i.e. not letting one person labour a point for 5-10 minutes when others have questions) is important however, as noted previously, sometimes talks are presented with a well rounded conclusion they don't invite questions. In these situations, it can be a very nice touch for the MC to give feedback or ask a light-touch question to get the ball rolling on questions from the audience.

Occasionally there are talks that invite many, many questions from the audience. In these cases, it's best to use your own judgement on whether or not to let the track overrun slightly to encourage debate.
