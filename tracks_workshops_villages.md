# Tracks, workshops, and villages (oh my)

Many conferences now follow a "multi-track" format. This can allow you to accept more talks than you originally had planned for. Be aware however that complexity of running a multi-track conference increases greatly with each additional track, [workshop](#workshops), or [village](#villages). Not every conference needs multiple tracks and, while it might be disappointing to reject speakers, sometimes the simplicity of having a single track is appealing.

## Kids track

A popular addition to many conferences, 

As Steelcon beautifully put it - a kids track shouldn't be seen as a crèche, but rather a child friendly version of the conference where they can learn and have fun.

## Sponsors / vendors

Depending on the benefits laid out in your [sponsor pack](guides/sponsors.md), you might have offered sponsors an area where they can set up a stand to speak to attendees. Ensure you have enough space, tables, chairs, and similar items.

Sponsors and vendors will likely want, or need, access to power for their table – ensuring there's sufficient room to run cables safely to give vendors access to electricity if needed.

## Villages

"Villages" are similar to workshops but far less formal. It's common at infosec events for lockpicking, sticker trade, car hacking, or even just an area where people want to show off the cool *thing* they built to the community to need some space. As they're not workshops, they often don't need official schedules (although some villages might do timed competition events - such as the lockpicking village) but will require a large area, usually with things like access to power, to function well.

Some villages (such as the car hacking, plane hacking, or train hacking) may require very large spaces or require strange equipment to be brought on site. It's worth narrowing down what villages you wish to invite, making an audit of the space available, and having a chat with your venue ahead of time to alleviate any concerns they may have. Even if the village sounds mundane and normal to you, the venue may have concerns that need addressing.

## Workshops

Unlike villages, workshops tend to be a more formal interactive classroom style item on the agenda. Workshops can be of varying length (with anything from 30 minutes to a full day) but tend to see attendees staying for the full duration of the workshop. Having a classroom style environment with a projector, much like main tracks albeit a bit more intimate, is recommended.
