# Volunteers

Volunteers can be broken down into four distinct groups â€“ AV technicians, General, MCs, and Runners. Volunteers should be "stuck" to their role for the entire conference period (meaning that an MC shouldn't be pulled to be a runner and a runner shouldn't be pulled to be an AV tech) however, things happen. Understand your volunteer cohorts' skillsets and utilize them as best you can.

## Pre-conference organisation

## Skill levels

There are some people that volunteer religiously at conferences, and some who it's their first time. 

## Types of Volunteers

### AV

Will support the speaker ensuring that they are comfortable and understand if they can move around the stage or need to stay at a podium if they are not mic'ed up. AV can be a very rewarding role but is often daunting for a first time volunteer so a few experienced AV staff on hand will smooth this over.

### General

Signposting attendees to talks, controlling access to track's after a talk has started to ensure no disruption for the speaker. In the event of an emergency, they will form part of the escorts to safely leave a building.

### MC's

MCs are the face of your conference when you're not around. They will introduce speakers, field questions and "run" a track.

### Runners

Something always happens, use the runners to go and get the extra AAA batteries for the microphones, or to simply ensure staff get to eat during the day, it's easy to get caught up.


## Volunteer recognition

Volunteers donate their time to help making your conference a success but many of them don't get the same level of credit an organiser does. It's always nice to recognise a volunteer teams' contributions either via social posts, shoutouts, similar.

Setting your conference entity up as a Linked In company page and encouraging volunteers to add it under Volunteering experience can give volunteers a feeling of community, and a positive impact to your conference entity.
